# Themes

Moon Design System is decentralized and intended to support multiple products. The use of different-color naming conventions and numbers makes maintenance more difficult. We decided to give each of our colors a distinct name, adopting the Dragon Ball Z approach. Each color name is assigned for a specific purpose, and the values vary according to the product. Please do not use hex values; they will not change if you need theme support.

## Main colors

The main colors serve a specific purpose. `piccolo` and `hit` are used for accent colors; `beerus` for borders and lines; `goku` and `gohan` for backgrounds; `bulma` and `trunks` for text and icons; `goten` and `popo` for forced theme-less colors; and `jiren`, `heles`, and `zeno` for semi-transparent overlays.

## Supportive colors

Every HEX color in all supportive colors is represented by three shades. The difference between shades is in their transparency levels. Some colors may have a semantic purpose. `krillin` is usually used for warnings, `chichi` for errors, and `roshi` for success colors. Other colors are used for variety of secondary reasons.
