TagsInput is an extension of the text input fields. This component allows users to both enter text and capture input results and display them as well.

These selected text entries are being displayed as tags. Tags represent a set of interactive keywords that help organize and categorize objects.

Tags can be added by pressing the <kbd class="inline-block whitespace-nowrap rounded px-1.5 font-medium tracking-wide text-moon-14 border border-beerus text-trunks ms-auto">Enter ⏎</kbd> key or removed by the mouse click from the input element.
