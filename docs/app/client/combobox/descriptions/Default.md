title: Default / Nullable
---

The `<Combobox />` component enables selection from a defined range of options. Its `nullable` property determines if the selected value can be cleared or not.
<br/>
To provide informative helper text below the dropdown field, utilize the `<Combobox.Hint />` sub-component.
<br/>
The `<Combobox />` also offers multiple placement options determined by the `position` property, as detailed in the `props table` below. The default position is `bottom` when not specified.
