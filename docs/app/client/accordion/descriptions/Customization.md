In case you need to add some extra styling to the `<Accordion />` component, you can easily use the `className` property. It applies not only to the `<Accordion />` component itself but also to all its sub-components - `<Accordion.Item />`, `<Accordion.Header />`, `<Accordion.Content />`, and `<Accordion.Button />`.
