In case you need to add some extra styling to the `<BottomSheet />` component, you can easily use the `className` property. It applies not only to the `<BottomSheet />` component itself but also to all its sub-components - `<BottomSheet.Panel />`, `<BottomSheet.Draghandle />`, `<BottomSheet.Title />`, and `<BottomSheet.Backdrop />`.
