title: Size
---

`Form` items, by default, have a medium size. You can set a `Form` `size` property to `sm` or `lg` to manipulate the sizing of use `Input` and `NativeSelect` components. `Textarea` does not have a `size` property and will remain the same. You need to paste the corresponding `size` into the `Button` component in order to fit it into the general `Form` style.
