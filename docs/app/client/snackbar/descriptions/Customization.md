In case you need to add some extra styling to the `<Snackbar/>` component, you can easily use the `className` property. It applies not only to the `<Snackbar />` component itself but also to all its sub-components - `<Snackbar.Icon />`, `<Snackbar.Close />`, `<Snackbar.Content />`, `<Snackbar.Header />` and `<Snackbar.Message />`.
