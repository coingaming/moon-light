As a compound component, `<Snackbar />` allows you to tailor its content according to your preferences. Utilize one or several `<Snackbar.Message />` sub-components for a single-line or multiline option. Sub-elements like `<Snackbar.Header />`, `<Snackbar.Close />`, and `<Snackbar.Icon />` add their respective content. Simply follow the component structure illustrated in the `anatomy` snippet above and combine the content as needed.
