A form input used for selecting a value: when collapsed it shows the currently selected option and when expanded, it shows a scrollable list of predefined options for the
user to choose from.

Moon supports two types of selects, one which opens browser(s) [native styling](#) option list and `<Dropdown />`.
<br/>
`<Dropdown />` component supports various sizes by using the `size` prop. If not specified, the default size is Medium (`md`).
